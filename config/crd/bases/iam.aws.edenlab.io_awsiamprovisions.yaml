                            The trust relationship policy document that grants an entity permission to
                            assume the role.

                            In IAM, you must provide a JSON policy that has been converted to a string.
                            However, for CloudFormation templates formatted in YAML, you can provide
                            the policy in JSON or YAML format. CloudFormation always converts a YAML
                            policy to JSON format before submitting it to IAM.

                            The regex pattern (http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex) used to validate this
                            parameter is a string of characters consisting of the following:

                              - Any printable ASCII character ranging from the space character (\u0020)
                                through the end of the ASCII character range

                              - The printable characters in the Basic Latin and Latin-1 Supplement character
                                set (through \u00FF)

                              - The special characters tab (\u0009), line feed (\u000A), and carriage
                                return (\u000D)

                            Upon success, the response includes the same trust policy in JSON format.

                          description: |-
                            The maximum session duration (in seconds) that you want to set for the specified
                            role. If you do not specify a value for this setting, the default value of
                            one hour is applied. This setting can have a value from 1 hour to 12 hours.

                            Anyone who assumes the role from the CLI or API can use the DurationSeconds
                            API parameter or the duration-seconds CLI parameter to request a longer session.
                            The MaxSessionDuration setting determines the maximum duration that can be
                            requested using the DurationSeconds parameter. If users don't specify a value
                            for the DurationSeconds parameter, their security credentials are valid for
                            one hour by default. This applies when you use the AssumeRole* API operations
                            or the assume-role* CLI operations but does not apply when you use those
                            operations to create a console URL. For more information, see Using IAM roles
                            (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use.html) in the

                            IAM user, group, role, and policy names must be unique within the account.
                            Names are not distinguished by case. For example, you cannot create resources
                            named both "MyResource" and "myresource".

                            This parameter allows (through its regex pattern (http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex))
                            a string of characters consisting of upper and lowercase alphanumeric characters
                            with no spaces. You can also include any of the following characters: _+=,.@-
                          type: string
                        path:

                            The path to the role. For more information about paths, see IAM Identifiers

                            This parameter is optional. If it is not included, it defaults to a slash
                            (/).

                            This parameter allows (through its regex pattern (http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex))
                            a string of characters consisting of either a forward slash (/) by itself
                            or a string that must begin and end with forward slashes. In addition, it
                            can contain any ASCII character from the ! (\u0021) through the DEL character
                            (\u007F), including most punctuation characters, digits, and upper and lowercased
                            letters.

                            for the role.

                            A permissions boundary policy defines the maximum permissions that identity-based
                            policies can grant to an entity, but does not grant permissions. Permissions
                            boundaries do not define the maximum permissions that a resource-based policy
                            can grant to an entity. To learn more, see Permissions boundaries for IAM
                            entities (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_boundaries.html)
