                            IAM user, group, role, and policy names must be unique within the account.
                            Names are not distinguished by case. For example, you cannot create resources
                            named both "MyResource" and "myresource".

                            You must provide policies in JSON format in IAM. However, for CloudFormation
                            templates formatted in YAML, you can provide the policy in JSON or YAML format.
                            CloudFormation always converts a YAML policy to JSON format before submitting
                            it to IAM.

                            The maximum length of the policy document that you can pass in this operation,
                            including whitespace, is listed below. To view the maximum character counts
                            of a managed policy with no whitespaces, see IAM and STS character quotas
                            (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_iam-quotas.html#reference_iam-quotas-entity-length).

                            In IAM, you must provide a JSON policy that has been converted to a string.
                            However, for CloudFormation templates formatted in YAML, you can provide
                            the policy in JSON or YAML format. CloudFormation always converts a YAML
                            policy to JSON format before submitting it to IAM.
